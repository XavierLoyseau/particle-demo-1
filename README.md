# particle-demo

- finite size particles
- collisions
- drag force or user specific force dependant on position
- wall and or periodic boundaries
- write/read from csv files

## Cases

### 1D case
Just an interval and particles with velocities in x direction only.
#### Walls BC
Ends of the interval are bounded by walls
#### Periodic BC
The simulation is periodic

### 3D box
#### Wall bounded box
#### Periodic box
